                <p>Hi! My name is Rishabh Kanodia and I'm an academic sophomore at GT! I love building all sorts of things in my free time; devices, models, robots, and drawing. Some of my favorite projects have been applying these to skills to help organizations around my community. I look forward to expanding my skills through BoG and other orgs here at GT as well as meeting all the new people!</p>
